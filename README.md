# Continuous profiling

Continuous profiling is technique to collect profile snapshots from processes and aggregate them similar to what Prometheus does to metrics. This enables us to find regressions across different versions and find inefficient code paths.


---
# pprof

Golang apps can be profiled with `pprof` tools either locally (i.e. during unit test run) or remotely via HTTP endpoint.

kube-apiserver in OpenShift exposes `/debug/pprof` endpoint, protected via RBAC, so its most useful for remote profiling.

# How does continuous profiling work?

Most solutions come with two options:
* direct pprof endpoint scraping
* eBPF âœ¨

Profiles are fetched, labelled and stored in DB. The UI later on allows to filter profiles by labels and time, displaying the flamegraph as result.

eBPF magic allwos to produce profiles without exposing pprof endpoints. Instead the kernel is instructed to record syscals coming from the process - and the app reconstructs which function was called using golang runtime metadata.

The downside of eBPF solution is that it can only record the basics - CPU time and memory usage, while golang pprof endpoint can also expose information about created goroutines and time spent on blocking I/O.

# Continuous profiling solution

Two market leaders:
* Parca by PolarSignals - Frederic Branczyk's startup
* Pyroscope by Grafana

Parca has pioneered the idea, created custom-made DB and UI, while Pyroscope has great integration with Grafana and somewhat better aggregation methods.

# Tips & Tricks

https://pprof.me/ - share profiles

`go tool pprof -http=:8080 -trim_path=/go -source=<srcdir> <path/to/profile.gz>` - inspect profile alongside source code

---
# What's next?

Partner with performance team, who already record metrics and logs during performance tests. Profiling results would be useful to determine the source of the regression up to a particular function and a change in the codepath.
